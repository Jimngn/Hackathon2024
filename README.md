This is our submission for the Hackathon 2024. This is our pygame that includes a level built from each team member, and has specific aspects incorporated from the 2024 astral calender, particularly from the days November 1st-November16-17th. This project will be submitted to the beginner track, as we are all freshmen with very little python experience, but we thought we would make it space themed as well for the fun of it. Creators; Jim Nguyen, Mary Irfan, Zi Ni, and Tyler Greaves.
